# Light pulses calculation code.
This code provides numerical simulation of localized light pulses with arbitrary spatial and temporal envelops. Calculations are based on the approach, considered in [reference]. The work is supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, grant 18-32-00906.

The following manual describes functions, modules, and objects included.
# Module 'pulse'.
This module contains function `save_result(result, name, delimiter, number='')`, that saves data during calculation and the main class `pulse`.

Class `pulse`:
```python
pulse(boundary, x_range, y_range, real_type='abs', *args)
```
Generates `pulse` class instance from spatial boundary condition, spatial ranges and defines the way of real field getting from complex amplitude.

Attributes:
